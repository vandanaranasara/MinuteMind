Maya:
Good morning, everyone. We need to close out the last phase of AI integration before the January launch. I want to check progress, marketing dependencies, and any risks we still need to handle.

Arjun:
Morning. Integration with the backend is almost done—around 80 percent. The model is working, but the response time is still high. Right now it's about 2.4 seconds per query, and we need it under 1.5 seconds.

Neha:
Yes, the latency issue is mainly because the embeddings pipeline is heavy. I can try batching or switching the vector store from FAISS to Chroma. That should reduce the load time.

Maya:
Alright. Neha, can you take that optimization task? When can you finish it?

Neha:
If everything goes smoothly, I can complete it by Wednesday and share the benchmark results.

Kabir:
On the marketing side, we’re preparing all campaign materials, but we need a working demo video by Friday. Without that, we can’t finalize the landing page or schedule the social posts.

Arjun:
That’s fine, but we can only record the demo if the latency improvement is solid. Otherwise the demo will look slow.

Maya:
Understood. So Neha will optimize by Wednesday, Arjun will prepare the demo environment by Thursday, and Kabir needs the final video by Friday.

Kabir:
Also, we need a short script explaining the AI assistant—what it does and what makes it unique. Who’s handling the writing?

Maya:
I’ll draft the script, but I need both of you to share inputs on technical features.

Arjun:
I can send my bullet points today.

Neha:
And I’ll add details about the model pipeline and sentiment features.

Maya:
Great. Any open risks we haven’t covered?

Arjun:
We still haven’t tested the system under heavy load. If traffic spikes on launch day, we might face scalability issues.

Neha:
Right. We need at least one solid stress-test round. I can prepare synthetic query scripts for that.

Maya:
Perfect. When can you start?

Neha:
Once I'm done with optimization, I can begin stress-testing on Friday.

Kabir:
Quick question—are we including multilingual support in the first release?

Arjun:
Not fully. English is stable, but Hindi accuracy is around 70 percent. I suggest we mark multilingual support as beta for now.

Maya:
Good idea. Kabir, please add that to the release notes.

Kabir:
Will do. One last thing—do we have the onboarding FAQ ready?

Arjun:
Almost. I’ll complete it by Monday.

Maya:
Great. That’s everything for today. Thanks, everyone.
